# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Project
This project is an Implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms and how it is used as a tool in the pricing of financial derivatives. It is supported by computational tasks that analyses the practical performance of the Euler scheme and Monte Carlo method, observing convergence in both and methods for speeding up the Monte Carlo method by reducing variance.
